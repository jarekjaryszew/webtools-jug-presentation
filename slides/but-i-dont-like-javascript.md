##  JavaScript sucks, I don't want to code in it

+ I agree - JavaScript (ECMA Script) is a very primitive language with nasty quirks.
+ But there is nothing else to use on browser currently
+ Unless we want to compile something else to JavaScript
+ Java applets and Flex are dead
+ Dart is nowhere near
