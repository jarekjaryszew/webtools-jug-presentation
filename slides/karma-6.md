##  Karma

+ Config stored in file, usually karma.config.js
+ You can initialise empty file by ``` karma init <file name>```
+ Tests started via ``` karma start karma.conf.js```
+ Usually more then one config:
 + one for development, specs will be run one every tracked file save.
 + one for continuous integration, single run often with PhantomJS
