##  Portability

+ Browser (and webviews) are currently most convenient runtimes if we want to go crossplatform
+ We all know many products based on webviews like: Spotify, Steam
+ We have even frameworks like Ionic and PhoneGap to write boilerplate for different mobile platforms
+ NodeJS is becoming really popular application runtime, not only for cli tools but also for desktop apps (Atom editor)
