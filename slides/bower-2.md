##  Bower 2

Bower is package agnostic dependency manager, meaning it does not care what is in the package!

To set it up install it globally:

```
npm install -g bower
```

Getting package is as simple as that:

```
bower install jquery skeleton
```

Default installation location is project_root/bower_components
