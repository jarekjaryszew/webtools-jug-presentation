##  Grunt 2

Before you start using grunt in your project you have to install following package globally:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

This is not grunt yet. Only simple tool to discover the grunt instance in your project and run it. Thanks to that solution you always have grunt in your path and still can choose particular version for your project.
